# Dry-Bean-Classification
## Abstract
This Work is composed of an accurate developement of a Machine Learning pipeline targeted on the Dry Bean Dataset (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dry+Bean+Dataset).
Valuable pre-processing steps have been included in the pipeline and different Machine Learning methods have been
carefully selected and implemented, to correctly classify different kinds of beans. Two types of evaluation metrics have been used to test
the modelsâ€™ performances. Overall, the results achieved are accurate and satisfactory, and the whole pipeline has been
demonstrated to be optimal for the chosen task.
